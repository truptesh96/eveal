**Your next SEO Plugin is NOT just an SEO Plugin.**
It's a Non-Human Private SEO Consultant.
Powered by Machine Learning and Cloud Services.
It's the First of its kind.
It's the new Squirrly 2021: Smart Strategy and it lives and works inside your WordPress.

We've made Expert-Level SEO Advice (the kind you'd pay consultants $2,500 USD / month) very accessible for WordPress site owners, small business owners, professional bloggers, freelancers, agencies.

How can you start getting the advice?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drRVRBFYUKA

Having studied over 600,000 WordPress sites with performance metrics, growth metrics, this new Non-Human consultant has 7 years of experience and "knows" what you need in order to become successful. Just like all the people in our <a title="Squirrly SEO Success for WordPress Users" href="https://www.squirrly.co/successful/">Success Stories Who Followed Squirrly's Advice.</a>

Our Cloud Services analyze the client's website (your website if you start using it) to reveal priority tasks that need solving. Next, the services and the machine learning identify actionable steps for boosting Google rankings, monitor SEO performance, and recommend strategy adjustments, when needed ("knows" this according to the 600,000 sites it studied).

That's why the new Squirrly is called Smart Strategy. Because it has experience, knowledge and can think all of the complicated aspects on your behalf (just like a Human consultant would too).

Better yet, it does all the exciting new things you've just read about on top of everything else that was already available in our software suite. You can read more about it in the lines that follow.

**The three things you should look for in a SEO plugin:**

1) to increase (scientifically, not based on hope) the chances of **being found on search engines**. Always On. Always Reporting. Giving you a holistic view of how Google sees your pages and what it needs to decide to move your page up in search results.

2) to give you **clear "maps" (and navigation directions, just like Waze app) for ranking pages continuously** by using a method, not random "fixes".

3) to **give you an edge** over the 60,000 or 60,000,000 other pages competing with your page for the same keyword. Those sites probably already have Yoast installed. If all you do is install that SEO plugin yourself, how will that help you be better than them? - No, to be competitive you need Squirrly SEO.

Try it today! **You won't lose SEO rankings switching** to Squirrly, because it imports all technical settings you made in other plugins.

Or you can choose to keep technical SEO settings in other plugins, and **use the innovations from Squirrly SEO** on top of those plugins (they can work together).

"Wow ,I've been using your tool for a week now and one of my blog ranked no1 out of a million for its key word... amazing" - **Pierre Perpal.**

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vp7Fu1HZs2s

Launched in 2012 in the United Kingdom, Squirrly Limited today has over 6,455 clients in 90 countries, including such megabrands as Microsoft and the BBC. Yet, it says the heart of its focus is "the little guy" i.e. the small and medium-sized businesses and bloggers that need expert marketing support so they can keep focused on day-to-day operations.

**"I had SEO companies tell me they could do this (get me to the first page of Google) but it all takes time and wanted thousands of dollars. Squirrly SEO saved me that money many times over!" - Drew Spangler, Orlando Homeopathic Body Works.**

There are multiple success stories with following the "navigation" instructions offered by Focus Pages - agencies, freelancers, business owners, affiliate marketers, professional content marketers. <a title="Squirrly SEO Success for WordPress Users" href="https://www.squirrly.co/successful/">Read their Stories.</a>

"Find long-tail keywords with legitimate ranking opportunities for your blog, not just a shot in the dark, but a solid target audience to market your blog too. The Squirrly plugin will eliminate all your worry, pressure, and sense of overwhelm when it comes to optimizing your blog. It has everything organized for you and will show you new tips to help you improve your blog's domain authority over time." - **Dawn, owner at OhBlogOnIt.**

This high-end SEO software gathered thousands of testimonials. Has been featured on TechCrunch, Search Engine Journal, Search Engine Watch and others. <a title="Official WordPress SEO Plugin Website" href="https://plugin.squirrly.co/">See more on our official site. PRO versions on our site. Free version here on WordPress.</a>

Is it compatible with other SEO Plugins? - yes, because it really enhances the other plugins. You can use those other plugins to go in the wrong direction and even get your website penalized. Focus Pages from Squirrly will help you make those plugins really work well for your SEO Strategy.

= Focus Pages is an innovation that you can't even find in SEMrush, nor in Moz, nor in aHrefs. =

It's a complete game changer, because it tells you what to do with each page to make it found on search engines.

Just turn RED elements into Green.

Squirrly offers details for every item and an action button which you can press to start turning the red element to green. Provides you with a simple, guided flow.

If you **keep turning reds to greens, you'll keep improving your chances of ranking**. If you reach 100% for a page, that page will be found on Google. Sometimes, you'll be lucky and end up on the first page of Google even with just 70% chances.

<a title="Learn SEO from Squirrly. For Free." href="https://www.squirrly.co/seo/">Squirrly provides you with:</a>
- a **FREE Education Cloud** (learn everything about optimizing for Humans and for Search Engine Bots)
- **Free coaching sessions**
- a 14 Days Journey to Better Ranking. **14 daily recipes to follow** to make your WordPress site ready for high-performing SEO.

= Is Squirrly a free plugin? - YES. Don't believe those who claim otherwise. We even give you the incredible Focus Pages innovation for free inside the plugin. You can use it to rank one page at a time, using everything inside. =

The free plugin is limited in terms of feature usage (volume-based usage), it doesn't cut features. Some features might be found in the Lite version, instead of PRO, Web Dev Kit, or Business version, but they aren't cut off.

Also, the **FREE plugin from Squirrly offers you the PAID features from plugins** such as Yoast, RankMath, SEOpress, SEOpressor. You get their paid features for free, just by installing Squirrly SEO right now.

There's even a completely No-Ads free version available <a title="Free" href="https://www.squirrly.co/developers/kit/">here.</a> It will not send you SEO Audits! (because it doesn't ask for an email so it can't do that; due to this: you'll also miss out on coaching, website alerts, new keyword opportunities and offers). Find the button on the page that says: "Try a sample of a Web Dev Kit zip file".

It's a freemium software (like MailChimp). The PRO features come from our servers and our multiple APIs. So switching to PRO doesn't require you to change the plugin. You'll still be using the exact zip file even when you go to our PRO, Business or Agency Plans.

You need to gain an edge over all the ranking factors (at least 60 such factors) that aren't covered by WordPress SEO Plugins.

Focus Pages by Squirrly, the SEO Live Assistant, the Keyword Research, the Audit Suite (does 6 types of audits for you weekly), the Briefcase (an overview on your current SEO strategy) and the Google Ranking inside Squirrly SEO will make all the difference in the world.

= SEMrush and MOZ don't even come close to offering the analysis and clear navigation that Focus Pages by Squirrly offers you. =

Move way beyond what Yoast can offer. Why install yet another Yoast clone (that isn't as well made as the popular Y plugin), when you can sky-rocket your rankings with the high-end SEO software from Squirrly which goes beyond what even giants like SEMrush and Moz can offer?

Squirrly's SEO Automation features are more advanced and for many more custom post types and taxonomies than the one you find in all other SEO Plugins. The sitemap is also more advanced.

We've made it super easy to Switch everything to Squirrly SEO. All Your Optimizations. One easy button.

However, we've done more than that for you: **we've made Squirrly SEO  compatible with all other SEO plugins**, so you don't even have to make the switch to benefit from our ground breaking Focus Pages feature that you've seen on the video inside this page.

= Download and start using now. Or keep reading more about this insanely great WordPress SEO Plugin =

This is a New Squirrly. It looks at each page on your WordPress site the same way Google does. It translates everything for you with simple red and green elements. You'll get the answers you were waiting for.

This is the only plugin and SEO software capable of adapting to the specifics of each page and the context it has inside a website. It provides answers for you, after very complex analysis made on multiple levels.

There are about 20 Million pages that Google can display for every single search a user makes. How does Google decide to display YOUR page within the first 10 results? Out of millions of pages it could display?

The new SEO Squirrly knows the answer. Powered by advanced cloud servers owned by the Squirrly Company, the MarketIntelligence big data analysis we do, and data sources like: Moz, Majestic, Alexa, Semrush, Google Analytics, ContentLook, crawlers owned by Squirrly: we are in a unique position that allows us to see each page the same way that Google's algorithms see it.

Squirrly provides different answers for different pages for different website owners, because you can't treat any two pages from the Web the same way. Google doesn't. Since we released this, we brought more success to our customers than ever before:  <a title="Squirrly SEO Success for WordPress Users" href="https://plugin.squirrly.co/seo-success/">SEO Success With Squirrly's Algorithms</a>

"Turn Red Elements to Green and You Will Win." Some of the customers from the success stories mentioned above did not believe we've made everything so easy. They tried it. And they were convinced.

It has been our mission to help you take pages from "Never Found to Always Found". With the new Squirrly we've managed to fully deliver on our promise. But for us, this is only the beginning.

It's time to rethink the old way of doing search engine optimization for WordPress.

Why? Because the old way of doing things is no longer relevant to how search engines work today. Because Google does NOT perceive your pages as being all the same.

There is no "one size fits all" in SEO, so using an SEO plugin that treats all pages the same way is dangerous for your business.

It's like applying a random treatment regardless of the symptoms, just because it had worked once (in another case) for another patient. Would YOU put your faith in that?

No.

It makes absolutely no sense, not when you can use Squirrly SEO (brand new. complete redesign) which looks at your pages like Google does.

The revolutionary <a title="The Revolutionary Concept And Method" href="https://plugin.squirrly.co/focus-pages/">concept of Focus Pages</a> is here to transform and innovate the way you optimize your WordPress site because it's not enough to have a destination (being found on the first page of Google).

You also need an updated map for HOW to get there. We built Focus Pages to provide a customized route to reach that First Page destination for each one of your pages.

Everything from creating human-optimized content to SEO keywords and the user's experience on your site is checked for in one way or another. Also factors related to quality signals like: impressions, clicks, ctr, social signals, inner links, links from other sites, authority of sites sending links to you.

In fact, Squirrly SEO now looks at over 54 critical ranking factors that Google takes into account when analyzing a page and deciding how high to place it in SERPs.

For every page that you add as a Focus Page inside Squirrly SEO, the plugin will show you exactly what actions to take to rank a particular page higher in Google. You'll know precisely what to focus on to generate the most impact.

Everything is shaped into clear tasks, and all you need to do is turn the RED elements you will see inside into Green. That's all!.

The details will be completely different from page to page because every page has its own path to SEO success and this is not a generic plugin. So you won't be given a generic analysis.

This is the only plugin and SEO software capable of adapting to the specifics of each page and the context it has inside a website.

The amount of data being processed and the way we process the data is a culmination of groundbreaking work.

With the new Squirrly SEO, we fix problems related to SEO that no other plugin or software can fix. Because we approach things in a way that hasn't been done before.

Just makes things look nice. To make these elements really work for ranking higher, you need all levels of SEO.</a>

This is WordPress.

And Squirrly is the best WordPress SEO plugin you will find.

Because we build insanely great marketing software at the Squirrly company, we've decided to make the plugin part of our revolutionary SEO Software be a revolutionary plugin itself.

Unlike many other plugin creators, we've made the free version you download and install today on WordPress all that you will need.

We do have Squirrly PRO <a title="Insanely Great. SEO Platform." href="https://plugin.squirrly.co/">SEE Squirrly PRO.</a>, which takes everything you've just read here to the extreme.

You can even use Squirrly PRO to rank a page within the first 10 results in one week and on our plugin's homepage you can even read the documentation or the way we've applied that method multiple times.

However, the Squirrly PRO uses the same base plugin you find here. There is no other extra thing you will have to install in WordPress.

You can switch between free and pro anytime you want.

It's a Freemium model, like MailChimp.

We provide all plugin-related features on the Free accounts. And even lots of the API-based features (which come from our servers and the partner services as described in the beginning of this WP description for our best WordPress SEO Plugin).

That's how committed we are to offering you a WordPress SEO plugin that works together with you, according to how ready you are to invest more in your WordPress SEO.

We've had people switching to PRO only after gaining success and Page 1 rankings on Google with the free version. And you can read this in some of our success stories. <a title="Squirrly SEO Success for WordPress Users" href="https://plugin.squirrly.co/seo-success/">SEO Success With Squirrly's Algorithms</a>

The PRO helps you super-charge the results and gain more results for more pages.

However, the Free version is ground breaking in and of its own.

We are proud of it. Our many partners are also proud to install it on client websites.

Some agencies have clients for whom they install free and clients for whom they install PRO.

And yes, we offer Excellent Customer Service for the FREE plan too.
