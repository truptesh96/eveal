{#
    Pseudo metabox container. single column layout.

    Allows us to render metaboxes properly on pages that originally don't support it.

    Usage:
        Add your metaboxes via add_meta_box(). You can use different Twig templates for
        each of them.

        Then, simply include this template:
        {% include '@toolset/pseudo_metabox_container_single_column.twig' %}

    @since m2m
#}

{# Everything that's not toolset-prefixed absolutely must be here, otherwise the styling breaks completely. #}
<div id="poststuff" class="toolset-actual-content-wrapper" style="">
    <div id="post-body" class="metabox-holder columns-1">
        {#
            Note that postbox containers must be numbered from the right side to the left,
            otherwise the styling is not applied properly. It was a couple of fun hours figuring this out.
         #}
        <div id="postbox-container-2" class="postbox-container">
            {% block postboxesDefault %}
                {{ do_meta_boxes() }}
            {% endblock %}
        </div>
        <div id="postbox-container-1" class="postbox-container">
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
