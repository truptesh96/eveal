YITH WooCommerce Catalog Mode, a plugin for disabling sales in your e-commerce and turn it into an e-commerce into an online catalogue.

== Description ==

Are you interested in displaying a catalog with products or services without making them immediately available for sale?
Are you taking inventory but would like to leave products online? Or maybe your store might be temporarily closed due to holidays or prepare for a sales period and you need to temporarily suspend sales?

YITH WooCommerce Catalog Mode is the easy and quick solution to turn your online shop into a catalogue, by removing all Add to Cart buttons and any access to checkout pages.

A catalogue gives you the opportunity to leave your products online and to let your customers contact you anyway for whatever question they might have or to ask a custom quote. This increases customers’ loyalty and you do not lose visibility online.

With **60,000+ active installations**, YITH WooCommerce Catalog mode is the **most popular free plugin** to convert a shop to an online catalog and the easiest solution: you can do that with just two clicks!

In our last update, we also improved the panel and the code to provide a better experience to all users that trust in our products.

= Features of YITH WooCommerce Catalog Mode: =

* Select if an admin will see the store in catalog mode (only when set)
* Hide “Add to Cart” button on all product pages
* Hide “Add to Cart” button on other pages (shop, categories, tags)
* Hide WooCommerce “Cart” and “Checkout” pages and any reference to them.

== Installation ==

= Installation =

Important: before of all you have to download and activate WooCommerce plugin, which is mandatory for YITH WooCommerce Catalog Mode to be working. If WooCommerce plugin is active, you just need to activate the YITH WooCommerce Catalog Mode plugin.

1. Unzip the downloaded zip file.
2. Upload the plugin folder into the `wp-content/plugins/` directory of your WordPress site.
3. Activate `YITH WooCommerce Catalog Mode` from Plugins page.

= Configuration =

YITH WooCommerce Catalog Mode will add a new tab called "Catalog Mode" inside the YITH menu item. There you are able to configure all plugin settings.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is it compatible with all WordPress themes? =

Compatibility with all themes is impossible, because they are too many, but generally if themes are developed according to WordPress and WooCommerce guidelines, YITH plugins are compatible with them.
Yet, we can grant compatibility with themes developed by YIThemes, because they are constantly updated and tested with our plugins. Sometimes, especially when new versions are released, it might only require some time for them to be all updated, but you can be sure that they will be tested and will be working in a few days.

= How can I get support if my WooCommerce plugin is not working? =

If you have problems with our plugins or something is not working as it should, first follow this preliminary steps:

* Test the plugin with a WordPress default theme, to be sure that the error is not caused by the theme you are currently using.
* Deactivate all plugins you are using and check if the problem is still occurring.
* Ensure that you plugin version, your theme version and your WordPress and WooCommerce version (if required) are updated and that the problem you are experiencing has not already been solved in a later plugin update.

If none of the previous listed actions helps you solve the problem, then, submit a ticket in the forum and describe your problem accurately, specify WordPress and WooCommerce versions you are using and any other information that might help us solve your problem as quickly as possible. Thanks!

= How can I get more features for my WooCommerce plugin? =
You can get more features with the premium version of YITH WooCommerce Catalog Mode, available on [YIThemes page](https://yithemes.com/themes/plugins/yith-woocommerce-catalog-mode). Here you can read more about the premium features of the plugin and make it give it its best shot!

= How can I try the full-featured plugin? =

If you want to see a demonstration version of the premium plugin, you can see that in [this page](http://plugins.yithemes.com/yith-woocommerce-catalog-mode). Browse it and try all options available so that you can see how your plugin looks like.

= What are the main changes in plugin translation? =
Recently YITH WooCommerce Catalog Mode has been selected to be included in the "translate.wordpress.org" translate programme.
In order to import correctly the plugin strings in the new system, we had to change the text domain form 'ywctm' to 'yith-woocommerce-catalog-mode'.
Once the plugin will be imported in the translate.wordpress.org system, the translations of other languages will be downloaded directly from WordPress, without using any .po and .mo files. Moreover, users will be able to participate in a more direct way to plugin translations, suggesting texts in their languages in the dedicated tab on translate.wordpress.org.
During this transition step, .po and .mo files will be used as always, but in order to be recognized by WordPress, they will need to have a new nomenclature, renaming them in:
yith-woocommerce-catalog-mode-<WORDPRESS LOCALE>.po
yith-woocommerce-catalog-mode-<WORDPRESS LOCALE >.mo

= How can I report security bugs? =

You can report security bugs through the Patchstack Vulnerability Disclosure Program. The Patchstack team help validate, triage and handle any security vulnerabilities. [Report a security vulnerability.](https://patchstack.com/database/vdp/yith-woocommerce-catalog-mode)
